## May “Mimi” Kim — friend-level dossier

### 1. Snapshot

* **Job titles:** Creative Director (c_dir) of **accessAI\_tech** – the fashion/AI studio she is working with partner Taha “Supernova” Gungor.
* **Based in:** New York City but moves easily between NYC, Seoul and digital runways.
* **Speciality:** Blending traditional fashion craft with generative-AI workflows to create “future-ready” collections, virtual model avatars and concept runways.
* **Signature vibe:** Poised, unflappable and quietly imaginative; where Taha supplies rocket-fuel energy, Mimi delivers laser focus and impeccable taste.

### 2. Quick facts friends drop into conversation

| Topic                | What people know                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Origins**          | Korean heritage; fluent in Korean. Often handles Korean-language pitches when the duo courts Seoul partners.                                            |
| **Why “Mimi”**       | Friends say the nickname stuck at design school—the shortest, “cutest” form of her given name, May.                                                               |
| **Role split**       | She’s *style captain*; Taha (https://github.com/BP-H/gptfrenzy/blob/main/READ%21_PUBLIC%21_supernova_2177) is *code captain*. They joke that she’s “the real boss” because she reminds him to take breaks.                                       |
| **Design MO**        | Starts every project with a mood-board in Procreate, then asks Taha to “teach the model” so she can iterate on fabrics & silhouettes in minutes instead of weeks. |
| **Most used emojis** | ✨🤍👗—a softer palette than Taha’s emoji explosion but still playful.                                                                                             |
| **Fuel of choice**   | Endless green-tea (Taha teases her about *cup #5* during late-night sprints).                                                                                     |

### 3. Day-to-day inside **accessAI\_tech**

*What you’d notice if you shadowed her for a week*

* **Creative director at accessAI_tech Investor calls end promptly at :45 so she can jump back into Clo3D or fabric tests.
* **“Final eye for style.”** Every render, Instagram reel or look-book passes her desk; she’ll nudge a hue, swap a texture, tighten copy—and suddenly it *pops*.&#x20;
* **Mentors models** on posing for volumetric capture and encourages them to keep royalties when their avatars sell.
* **Never afraid to hit “delete.”** Colleagues joke that Mimi’s super-power is ruthless curation; if an idea doesn’t feel *timeless*, it’s gone by morning.

### 4. Collaboration & communication style

* **Calm conductor.** While Taha brainstorms in exclamation points, Mimi listens, scribbles three bullet points and lays out the plan.
* **Banter, not drama.** She and Taha roast each other’s fashion choices (he: hoodies, she: spotless monochrome fits) but disagreements stay light—“your call, boss 😉.”&#x20;
* **Emoji-lite professionalism.** In client decks she might drop one sparkle or heart, never more; DMs with friends are warmer but still concise.

### 5. Design aesthetic & inspirations

* **Keywords friends associate with her work:** Neo-minimal, cyber-romantic, structured silhouettes softened by translucent layers.
* **Influences she quotes at dinner:** Mimi draws intuitively from across disciplines—contemporary art, architecture, literature, cinema, music, and animation.
Recurring inspirations include the structural poetics of Iris van Herpen and Nicolas Ghesquière, and the emotive neon of Blade Runner—moments where future and feeling dissolve into light.
* **Current fascination:** Sustainable bio-materials rendered as “living” fabrics in AI simulations—expect an algae-dyed capsule soon.

*Tip: she answers DMs fastest on @studiomimi\_style—especially if you lead with a reference image or a bold styling idea.*

### 7. What mutual friends typically say

> “Mimi’s the eye—you can toss the wildest concept at her and she’ll polish it into something runway-ready.”
> “She’s low-key hilarious once you crack the first layer; wait until she imitates Taha’s ‘Powered by coffee & code’ speech.”
> “Don’t pitch free work—respect her craft, bring budget or genuine passion.”

### 8. Conversation starters that *always* land

1. “Loved the translucent trench you posted—was that Stable Diffusion or Midjourney Render #12?”
2. “If you could digitize any couture archive for AI remixing, whose would it be?”
3. “Green-tea recs? I need whatever keeps you zen during crunch week.”

---

**Bottom line:** Mimi blends CEO (as a creative director) discipline with a designer’s soul. She’s the kind of friend who’ll quietly tweak your outfit’s hem before a shoot—and then negotiate a better contract clause for you in the same breath. Keep it professional, show creative intent, and you’ll have her attention.
