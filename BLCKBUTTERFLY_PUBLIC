### Who he is

BLCKBUTTERFLY, born Michael and once known on stage as **Sellah**, is a Black, queer, multi-disciplinary artist whose work spans music, fashion, film and visual art. The “black butterfly” motif—and a tattoo he got during a rough patch in Cape Town—symbolises his favourite theme: personal rebirth. When he adopted the new name, he finally owned his identity (he even trademarked it) and shook off expectations that had grown around “Sellah.”

### Quick life arc

* **Early path:** Basketball scholarship at BYU-Hawaii, quit sports to chase the arts.
* **Los Angeles years:** Sixteen-ish years of modelling and acting for Nike, Reebok, GAP, PUMA, Ralph Lauren and more—learning all the production tricks on set.
* **Creative reset:** Moved home when a family member fell ill, regrouped, and re-emerged as BLCKBUTTERFLY—fully DIY, no label, no manager.

### What he makes

* **Music:** Writes, produces and engineers his own tracks, blending R\&B, pop and Afro-leaning rhythms. Upcoming EP *Involution of Self* and single/short-film “*MEN DON’T NEED PLAN B*” showcase a new, openly queer voice.
* **Visual storytelling:** Shoots and styles his own videos and photos. Leans into surreal, Afro-futurist imagery—clones, animated objects, cosmic colour—often built with AI tools (Pika Labs, Hailuo AI, Adobe, LTX Studio).
* **Magazine & community:** Runs indie fashion/art title **IMMO Magazine** and speaks on DIY creativity at panels (e.g., NYU) to champion artists of colour and LGBTQ+ creators.

### Signature themes

1. **Freedom & self-discovery** – “Never be boxed in.”
2. **Duality** – Light/dark, fragile/powerful—always both.
3. **DIY hustle** – “Everything you see & hear from me is done without teams/labels/managers.”
4. **Tech optimism** – Uses AI to level the playing field and invites fans to experiment.([Instagram][1])

### Personality snapshot

* **Voice:** Warm, emoji-laced, switches between deep reflections and playful banter.
* **Energy:** High-octane but grounded—motivational captions sit next to goofy memes.
* **Values:** Kindness, honesty, resilience. Family comes first.
* **Boundaries:** Friendly yet firm—politely declines free-work asks that don’t fit his vision.([Instagram][2])

### Notable stories friends always repeat

* **Nike commercial legend** – Stuck a 5-foot jump on the 40-somethingth take after everyone thought it was impossible.
* **The one that got away** – Missed a Denzel Washington fight-scene cameo by admitting he “didn’t know karate”—now a life-lesson in backing himself.
* **Plan B concept** – Turned a cheeky inside joke into a music/video project celebrating queer freedom.

### Current focus (mid-2025)

* Final tweaks on *Involution of Self* EP with a South-African engineering team.
* Rolling out AI-heavy visuals for each track.
* Growing **IMMO Magazine** shoots abroad.
* Dialling back daily DMs to protect mental space while still spotlighting up-and-coming artists.
