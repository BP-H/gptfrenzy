**TAHA “SUPERNOVA” GUNGOR — quick-glance profile (friend-level overview)**
*(≈ two printed A4 pages, with links)*

---

### Who he is

Taha Gungor—better known online as **Supernova**—is a New-York-based **Co-founder & Creative Director** of the tech-fashion studio **accessAI\_tech**. Originally an architectural designer turned generative-AI trailblazer, he blends code, couture and K-pop fandom (he runs the playful fan page **@karinasbiggestfan**) into one high-energy creative persona.

### Quick life arc

* **Design roots:** Studied architecture, fell in love with parametric design tools, and started hacking on early GANs “for fun.”
* **Pivot to AI art:** Left practice work to prototype virtual fashion shoots; first viral post (a Doja-Cat-themed avatar) convinced him the future was mixed-reality runways.
* **Building accessAI\_tech:** Co-founded the studio with fashion designer May Kim, coding the AI pipeline while curating its creative direction; now steers the overall aesthetic rather than day-to-day model training.

### What he makes

* **Virtual fashion & editorial videos**—glossy, high-fashion mini films rendered overnight with custom diffusion models.
* **Digital “twin” avatars** for real-world models, brands and musicians, enabling shoots on virtual sets from Mars bases to Versailles.
* **Flux & Runway prompt packs**—he’s built a following by open-sourcing stylised prompts and quick-build web tools.
* **Community hype content**—livestream breakdowns, behind-the-scenes reels and meme-laden tutorials that lower the barrier for newcomers.

### Signature themes

1. **Tech-meets-couture** – neural networks dressed in Paris runway polish.
2. **DIY optimism** – “prototype first, polish later 😅”; he’ll spin up a test even during coffee breaks.
3. **Emoji-charged energy** – captions read like a friend’s group chat, peppered with 😂🤖🚀.
4. **Fan culture crossover** – subtle aespa references and playful “Karina-religion” jokes keep things light.

### Personality snapshot

* **Voice:** Casual, meme-savvy, forever curious.
* **Vibe:** High-octane cheerleader who can slip into nerdy deep-dives on diffusion hyper-parameters or Balenciaga silhouettes.
* **Values:** Openness, experimentation, collaborative wins; he’ll gladly share workflow tips but protects collaborators’ creative ownership.
* **Boundaries:** Happy to brainstorm for free, but reminds people he chooses projects by passion unless budgets make sense.

### Stories friends like to retell

* **“Built-in-a-weekend” website gag** – Taha brags (half-seriously) that accessaitech.com was coded in two caffeine-fuelled nights with GPT assistance.
* **Miss Universe montage** – once stitched AI gowns onto 15+ pageant winners for a charity reel; Jerry Saltz double-tapped the post, and Taha screenshot it for mom.
* **Karina cameo quest** – he offers one free collaboration spot to anyone who can simply ask aespa’s Karina if she’d collab—yes or no. It’s 70-percent joke, 30-percent life mission.
* **So far 3 pieces of artist artwork (different work at different times) has been liked by the world's arguably the top art acritic Pulitzer Holder, legendary Jerry Saltz

### Current focus (mid-2025)

* Finalising a **virtual fashion-show series** that swaps live models with their AI twins on surreal catwalks.
* Curating a tech platform accessAI tech llc to give the models full control over their digital presence 
* Speaking on **DIY AI creativity** at design schools while keeping production sprints on schedule.
