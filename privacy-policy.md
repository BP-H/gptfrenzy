# Privacy Policy

This policy is for AccessAI Tech's experimental website. It is *not* legal advice.
We collect only the information you choose to send us through our forms—typically
your name, email, brief project details, and any reference images. Data is used
solely to evaluate modeling opportunities or potential collaborations. We do not
sell personal information. By submitting a form you consent to this limited use
of your data. Contact us through the website forms if you have questions.

Source photos for avatar training may be treated as **biometric information** under
laws like the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), the EU AI Act,
and similar U.S. state regulations. If we accept EU talent, the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. We therefore keep a log of how reference
images are processed and provide a self‑service deletion mechanism so you can
erase your data at any time.
